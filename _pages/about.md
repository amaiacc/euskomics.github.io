Euskomics brings together genomics experts from different research centers in the Basque Country (i.e., [BCBL](https://bcbl.eu/en), [CIC biogune](https://www.cicbiogune.es/) and [Biodonostia](https://www.biodonostia.org/)).

## Goals

Discuss recent papers in the field of genomics and to foster collaboration among its members.

So far this has taken the shape of a regular _Journal Club_.
